# SimpleSkyBlock - A Forge mod for Minecraft
I always loved playing vanilla Minecraft. Even without any mods it offers so many possibilities and mechanics to explore up to the last detail.Skyblock maps offered a new challenge, but without cheating or any mods you were missing some major gameplay paths.

So I created the SimpleSkyBlock mod. It won't add any new blocks, items, or other content. And it also doesn't make your Skyblock life much easier - that's not the goal of such kind of maps!But it enables you to create randomly generated Skyblock worlds, and gives you access to nearly all vanilla items and features by adding some new simple mechanics and recipes.

### Main features of this mod:
* Generating random skyblock worlds which will have their biomes and structures at the same location like normal generated worlds, but without nearly any blocks placed.
  * Therefore you can still build things like witch or guardian farms at the correct locations and also get every biome feature.
* Stronghold portal rooms will still be generated for entering the end.
* The Nether will have no netherrack or bedrock floor for a better Skyblock feeling. The End keeps unchanged.
* Added recipes for otherwise unobtainable items like ores, mycelium or red sand.
* Added one Villager who trades items like saplings, double flowers, sugar cane or cactus.
* Mechanics for getting elder guardian, cave spiders or even shrubs and ferns.
* Vanilla like Skyblock experience by making as few and small changes as possible.

For more details, have a look into the **[Wiki](../../wiki)**.

This mod is supposed to be played without any other mods that would change the gameplay. Compatibility with other mods is not tested yet. But if you have certain requests, let me know.
